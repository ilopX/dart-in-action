dart-in-action
==============

Accompanying source for the [Dart In Action book from Manning](http://goo.gl/XhCW7).  

Although the source code has changed due to breaking changes in the APIs, the underlying concepts (classes, interfaces,
isolates, functional programming and so-on, remain the same).

See the [print_book_v1](https://github.com/DartInAction/dart-in-action/tree/print_book_v1) branch for the original source code reference in V1 of the print book.

This code in the master branch is being migrated as Dart heads towards version 1.0 sometime in 2013.

Clone the master (current version of code) using the command:

    git clone https://github.com/DartInAction/dart-in-action.git

Or clone the original branch that matches the books code examples using:

    git clone -b print_book_v1 https://github.com/DartInAction/dart-in-action.git

As the code is updated, I'm also running dart2js against the output, so that you can simply checkout 
and load the relevant HTML files in any modern browser, even if you don't have Dartium.

## Using the `analyze_chapters` script

Ensure that `dart_analyzer` is on your path.  This is usually found in the Dart SDK location: `dart-sdk\bin\` (note, Dart SDK is also supplied with the Dart Editor)
