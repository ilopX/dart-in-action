See the [print_book_v1](https://github.com/DartInAction/dart-in-action/tree/print_book_v1) branch for the original source code reference in V1 of the print book.

This code in the master branch is being migrated as Dart heads towards version 1.0 sometime in 2013.

## Using the `analyze_chapters` script

Ensure that dart_analyzer is on your path.  This is usually found in the Dart SDK location: `dart-sdk\bin\` (note, Dart SDK is also supplied with the Dart Editor)
